# Jumia-instore-pickup-process
Jumia-Tech is a large supplier of consumer hardware devices such as laptops, tablets, printers, monitors, and cables. They have large stores in every state and also have an online store where customers can purchase items online and have it delivered to their home or delivered to the nearest Jumia-Tech store.
During the pandemic, as a business analyst at Jumia-Tech, I devised new process steps to improve the online purchases - in-store pickup process and tech support. For online purchases, customers can select in-store pickup at checkout, reducing delivery times and promoting social distancing.
