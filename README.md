# Jumia-instore-pickup-process

Jumia-Tech is a large supplier of consumer hardware devices such as laptops, tablets, printers, monitors, and cables. They have large stores in every state and also have an online store where customers can purchase items online and have it delivered to their home or delivered to the nearest Jumia-Tech store.
During the pandemic, as a business analyst at Jumia-Tech, I devised new process steps to improve the online purchases - in-store pickup process and tech support. For online purchases, customers can select in-store pickup at checkout, reducing delivery times and promoting social distancing.

# The Process flow chat for the current state of Jumia instore pick up process

When a customer makes a purchase online, they have the option to choose delivery to their nearest Jumia-Tech store. Upon the item's arrival at the store, the customer receives notifications via email and text message, prompting them to pick up their order. Upon arrival at the store, customers typically need to queue for up to 20 minutes as item pickup is managed alongside other customer service tasks.

When it's their turn, customers are required to confirm their identity and provide the tracking number from their notification. The staff then locate the package matching the provided tracking number, verify the customer's identity, and hand over the item. After this, the customer is free to leave the store.
